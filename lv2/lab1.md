```
kubectl exec -it volume-share-devops -c volume-container-devops-1 -- /bin/sh -c "echo 'Hello, this is news.txt' > /tmp/news/news.txt"
```

```
kubectl exec -it volume-share-devops -c volume-container-devops-2 -- cat /tmp/demo/news.txt
```
### Explanation
Shared Volume: Containers volume-container-devops-1 and volume-container-devops-2 in the same pod share an emptyDir volume named volume-share.

Mutual Access: Files written to /tmp/news in one container are accessible in the other container at /tmp/demo due to the shared volume.

Synchronized Changes: Modifications to files within the shared volume are instantly visible to all containers sharing the volume within the pod.
### Explanation commands
Note:

The first command writes "Hello, this is news.txt" to /tmp/news/news.txt in volume-container-devops-1.

The second command reads the content of /tmp/demo/news.txt in volume-container-devops-2, displaying the same text as written in the first command due to the shared volume.
